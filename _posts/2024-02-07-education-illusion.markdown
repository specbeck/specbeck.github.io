So recently, me and my friend were just chilling after our everyday classes were over, until out of nowhere he went: _"You know these things they teach us, they're utterly useless, I mean is there any practical significance to them, if any at all? We'd rather be better off learning practical work"_ which left me wondering for a while. So here's what I think about this topic and what I think my friend thinks about this topic. But first some crunchy context.

To start off, let's discuss what my friend is not finding so practical to study. We are in our final year of a co-major in computer science and physical sciences i.e. mathematics and physics (_so the very foundation of everything around us_). Now before you go on assuming stuff, just consider a couple more things that are necessary in our context. No matter how sunny it sounds, the reality is that our syllabus and our instructors are outdated. What do I mean by that? Most of the instructors won't walkthrough the material seriously, and the syllabus is almost 3-4 years old. For example: In the current day and age of almost Android 12+ we're supposed to study Android 4. It might sound bad here but there are cons to this too: _Physics and mathematics don't really change that much._ 

Now that we are on the same page, let's take the original point into consideration. Is "this education" really that worthless? In short, my take on this is, absolutely not. I can just, having made that statement, end this here and get on with life, but I'd rather elaborate on why I think what I do. We will, eventually, head over to my friends' point too.

So here comes my take of the argument. First and foremost, the things we're studying or are being taught are the very foundation of everything around us.
