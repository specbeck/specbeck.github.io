So recently, me and my friend were just chilling after our everyday classes were over, until out of nowhere he went: _"You know these things they teach us, they're utterly useless, I mean is there any practical significance to them, if any at all? We'd rather be better off learning practical work"_ which left me wondering for a while. So here's what I think about this topic and what I think my friend thinks about this topic. But first some crunchy context.

To start off, let's discuss what my friend is not finding so practical to study. We are in our final year a co-major in computer science and physical sciences i.e. mathematics and physics (_so the very foundation of evrtthing around us_). Now before you go on assuming stuff, just consider a couple more things that are necessary in our context. No matter how much sunny it sounds, the reality is that our syllabus and our teachers are outdated. What do I mean by that? Teachers won't take stuff seriously, and syllabus is like 5-7 years old
