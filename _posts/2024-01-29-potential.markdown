Potential, an inherent translation of capability, stored energy, or simply put, limit of things. Potential itself conforms based on the context its referred to in. One could infer that different things have varying amount of potential in them, and everything has some amount of potential in it, no matter how small they may be. And according to the rules of classical mechanics, they would be correct! (_Quantum/Modern mechanics has a very vague image of potential, in general, a very vague description of particles, which despite the vaugeness is very intuitive_). To form a picture, think of it this way, every object that is supposedly stationery, has a bound energy to it. Every object here means **every object** (_follows from the fact that everything is made up of nuclear particles_).

Having stated the fact that everything has potential in it, (_yes you too!_) tapping into that potential is what makes a "thing" useful. This potential made useful could very well be conformed to create new things with even greater potential. It is the very basis of life if we observe carefully: It could very well be the case that "something" having some potential  conformed into the world we live in today. (_specifically into the mental model of the big bang_) It doesn't just stop there, as life saw the so called potential, it conformed to form intricate living beings, which we take for granted today.

Other modern day potential stories can be derived by virtually experiencing them once, via the potentially rich devices we have.
Modern day examples that came to mind:
 AI, Rust, music, world evolution, bbx
