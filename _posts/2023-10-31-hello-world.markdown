Hey to the person reading this. Hope you're doing good. This is my first blog ever to be posted on the internet (I finally mustered up the courage to open up a blog). I've been thinking about doing this for a long-long time now, and put my thoughts somewhere for me to reflect and recollect or for some stranger to ponder upon while they randomly end up here, which is extremely rare!

I'm new to this, so I do not fully understand how blogging, or `jekyll` works for the time being but I'll surely iterate on this to make it better eventually.

Since this is a first post, I'll just put out a status check on the current world situation as of now.

The world now-a-days is nothing less than being on a bleeding edge of a sword. Be it the rise of LLMs and AI in general to the saturation in tech market, or the sparks of a World War III to the neverending climate crisis. There's too many things going on that it is almost/absolutely overwhelming to think about anything of significance. The thing affecting my and the life my fellow comarades the most is the huge exposion/adoption of AI models in our day to day lives. Suffice to say, it's the most revolutionary thing in the tech world, because it completely changes the way people used to work!

The uncertainity the future holds is at its peak, as noone really knows, or can predict how this story ends.
